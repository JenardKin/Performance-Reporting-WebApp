PROBLEMS WITH SCHEMA
	1. (issue with primary keys mostly resolved)
	2. DJANGO REQUIRES FORIEGN KEYS FOR MULTI-TABLE QUERIES.
	3. THE PROVIDED PKs DO NOT ALLOW THE PROVIDED DATA TO BE ENTERED DUE TO INTEGRETY ERRORS. (Currently no PK on t_EventData as a result)
	4. THE FORIEGN KEYS CAN NOT BE DEFINED TO MANY OF THE TABLES DUE TO BAD DATABASE DESIGN:
		--> NOT ENOUGH MATCHING COLUMNS IN THE 'LOCAL' TABLE FOR THE COMPOSITE PKs IN THE FORIGEN TABLE.

NOTE: THERE ARE NO FORIEGN KEYS IN THE CURRENT CONFIGURATION OF THE DATABASE
NOTE: THE EVENTDATA TABLE DOES NOT HAVE PRIMARY KEYS DUE TO DATA CONFLICTS.

THINGS THAT ARE MISSING AND/OR HAVE NO EXPLAINATION
    FOR THE STORED PROCEDURES:		
		
	 sp_WOPRNote	
		getDBTimeStampFromLocal(@siteID, @ts)
			
	sp_GetEventsCountorDowntime	
		GetMonthPivotStringFromDates(@startTime, @endTime)
		GetTimeStringFromYearAndMonth
		getDBTimeStampFromLocal
			
	sp_GetLostProductionCrosstab	
		GetTurbPivotStringBySiteAndGroup(@siteID, @groupID)
		GetDBTimeStampFromLocal(@siteID, @startTime)


PROBLEM WITH DJANGO MIGRATIONS
	It is currently setup that the migrations will be made to the WOPR database. This should not happen.
	The migrations should be made to an application specific database, like SQLlite.
	So, that should be changed someday.
